# Poem about Makefile

**Ode to the Makefile**

In the realm of code, a script so fine,
The Makefile stands, a true design.
With targets set and commands so clear,
It builds our world, year after year.

From README updates to hooks that bind,
The Makefile's tasks are well-defined.
A symphony of scripts, in harmony,
It orchestrates our code's destiny.

So here's to the Makefile, robust and true,
A tool for all that we pursue.
In every project, it plays its part,
The Makefile, the coder's heart.

**Sonnet for the Makefile**

Within the lines of Makefile's script,
Lies order, structure, and command.
With every target, dependencies gripped,
It guides the build with steady hand.

From poetry installs to commits so neat,
The Makefile ensures tasks are complete.
In structured form, it stands so grand,
A testament to the coder's plan.

Oh Makefile, with your rules so clear,
You lead us through the build with cheer.
In every line, a task defined,
Ensuring that our code's aligned.

So let us honor you, dear Makefile,
For making every build so worthwhile.

**Haiku for the Makefile**

Targets set with care,
Commands in a script so fair,
Makefile, always there.
