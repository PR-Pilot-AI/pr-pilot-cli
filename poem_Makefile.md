### Poem about Makefile

In the world of build and task,
The Makefile wears a mighty mask.
Commands and rules, it does compile,
To automate, to save our while.

With poetry and hooks, it stands,
Guiding us with firm commands.
From readme updates to commits so neat,
The Makefile makes our work complete.

So here's to this file, so grand,
A helper in the coder's hand.
In every project, old or new,
The Makefile's magic will ensue.
