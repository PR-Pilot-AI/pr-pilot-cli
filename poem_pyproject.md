### Poem 1: Ode to pyproject.toml

In the heart of the project, a file so wise,
The pyproject.toml, under open skies.
It holds the secrets, dependencies' call,
A guide for the project, standing tall.

With poetry's touch, it weaves the tale,
Of versions and packages, without fail.
From Python's core to rich's embrace,
In pyproject.toml, we find our place.

So here's to the pyproject, our guiding star,
In the world of code, it shines afar.
A testament to structure, a coder's delight,
In every project, it keeps us right.

### Poem 2: The pyproject's Tale

Once upon a project, in a land of code,
Lived a pyproject.toml, with tales to be told.
It spoke of dependencies, and scripts to run,
A roadmap for coders, from sun to sun.

With versions to pin, and packages to fetch,
It orchestrated builds, without a stretch.
From poetry's charm, to black's strict rule,
The pyproject's tale, always cool.

In the pyproject's embrace, structure did flow,
Helping every coder, to learn and grow.
A story of order, in lines penned,
The pyproject's tale, a coder's friend.

### Poem 3: The pyproject's Song

In the symphony of code, the pyproject sings,
Of dependencies and scripts, and many things.
A chorus of versions, in harmony they stand,
Guiding the coder, with a gentle hand.

From build to test, it lays out the score,
A melody of structure, forevermore.
With every package, and every line,
The pyproject's song, so divine.

So let us sing, in joyous refrain,
The pyproject's song, again and again.
For in its verses, we find our way,
In the world of code, it leads the day.
