# Poem about pyproject.toml

**Ode to the pyproject.toml**

In the heart of the project, structured and neat,
Lies the pyproject.toml, a developer's treat.
With dependencies listed and settings so clear,
It guides our build process, year after year.

From poetry's touch to the build's command,
The pyproject.toml helps us understand.
A file so vital, yet humble in name,
It ensures our project's never the same.

So here's to the pyproject, precise and true,
A cornerstone for all that we do.
In every project, it plays its part,
The pyproject.toml, the developer's heart.

**Sonnet for the pyproject.toml**

Within the lines of pyproject's form,
Lies order, structure, and command.
With every section, dependencies warm,
It guides the build with steady hand.

From tool settings to the build's core,
The pyproject.toml ensures we soar.
In structured form, it stands so grand,
A testament to the coder's plan.

Oh pyproject, with your rules so clear,
You lead us through the build with cheer.
In every line, a task defined,
Ensuring that our code's aligned.

So let us honor you, dear pyproject file,
For making every build so worthwhile.

**Haiku for the pyproject.toml**

Settings in a file,
Dependencies compile,
pyproject's true style.
