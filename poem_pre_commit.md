### Poem about .pre-commit-config.yaml

In the realm of commits, a file so grand,
.pre-commit-config.yaml takes a stand.
With hooks and checks, it guards the gate,
Ensuring code is up to date.

Black and flake8, side by side,
In this config, they do reside.
Python's best, they do enforce,
Keeping code on a righteous course.

So let us praise this YAML file,
For making commits free of guile.
In every push, in every pull,
It keeps our codebase clean and full.
