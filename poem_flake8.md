### Poem about .flake8

In the land of Python, rules are set,
With .flake8, no code regret.
A hundred lines, the limit clear,
Keeps the code concise, sincere.

No trailing spaces, no unused imports,
With flake8, the code reports.
A guardian of the coding style,
Ensuring quality all the while.

So let us thank this hidden file,
For making Python code worthwhile.
In every project, big or small,
.flake8 stands tall for all.
