### Poem 1: Ode to .flake8

In the realm of the code, a file so slight,
A .flake8 config, to keep our lines right.
With max lengths defined, at a hundred they stay,
Ensuring our code, in neat lines will lay.

With poetry's touch, it enforces the rule,
Keeping our scripts, so elegant and cool.
A guardian of style, in lines so concise,
The .flake8's wisdom, is truly precise.

### Poem 2: The .flake8's Tale

Oh .flake8, dear .flake8, you tell us the tale,
Of coding with style, in rules you'll not fail.
With limits to length, and guidelines so clear,
You guide us through coding, with standards held dear.

From the first line to last, you orchestrate well,
In the world of the repo, your story we tell.
With every restriction, you bring order and grace,
In the .flake8's embrace, we find our place.

### Poem 3: The .flake8's Song

Sing, oh .flake8, of the style's grand design,
Of rules and of limits, in a structure so fine.
With poetry's rhythm, you capture the flow,
Of the project's neatness, as we watch it grow.

In configs you flourish, with elegance and ease,
A testament to order, that aims to please.
From the first restriction, to the final line,
In the .flake8, we find a code so fine.
