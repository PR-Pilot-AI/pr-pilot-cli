# Example: Implementation Plan

This directory contains a number of plans that can be executed with Pilot. Each plan is a YAML file that describes a series of steps to be executed. 
Plans can be used to break down more complex tasks into smaller steps.


# Example 1: Quicksort

This plan demonstrates how to implement the Quicksort algorithm in Python. 

```shell
pilot plan quicksort.yaml
```
