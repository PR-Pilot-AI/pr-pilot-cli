I want you to understand the following about the build system of the project:
- What build system is used (e.g. Maven, Gradle, Makefile)?
- What are the build commands?
- What is the path of the main build file?
- What is the structure of the build file?
- Any manifests or configuration files related to the build system?
- What CI/CD system is used?
- Are there any Github actions in `.github/workflows`?
- Are any files in the '.' directory related to CI/CD?
