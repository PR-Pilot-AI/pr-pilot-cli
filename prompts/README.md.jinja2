# PR Pilot CLI

PR Pilot gives you a natural language interface for your Github projects.
Given a prompt, it uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to autonomously fulfill tasks by interacting with your code base
and Github issues.

Using [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), you can create powerful,
reusable commands that can be executed by PR Pilot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Open a terminal and `ls` into a repository you have [installed](https://github.com/apps/pr-pilot-ai/installations/new) PR Pilot.

### üìã Examples

You can run a prompt directly on the command line:

```bash
pilot "Tell me about this project!"
```

Ask PR Pilot to edit a file for you:

```bash
pilot --edit cli/cli.py "Make sure all functions and classes have docstrings."
```

Generate code quickly:

```bash
pilot -o test_utils.py --code "Write some unit tests for the utils.py file."
```

Ask about something on your screen:

```bash
pilot --snap "What is this code doing?"
```

Get an organized view of your Github issues:

```bash
pilot "Find all open Github issues labeled as 'bug', categorize and prioritize them"
```

Generate parts of your README with a [template](./prompts/README.md.jinja2):

```bash
pilot --direct -f prompts/README.md.jinja2 -o README.md
```

For more examples, check out the [prompts](./prompts) directory in this repository.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Options and Parameters

You can change the default settings with parameters and options:

```bash
{{ sh('python -m cli.cli --help') }}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The configuration file is located at `~/.pr-pilot.yaml`.

```yaml
# Your API Key from https://app.pr-pilot.ai/dashboard/api-keys/
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY

# Default Github repository if not running CLI in a repository directory
default_repo: owner/repo
```
