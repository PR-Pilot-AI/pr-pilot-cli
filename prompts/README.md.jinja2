# PR Pilot CLI

PR Pilot gives you a natural language interface for your Github projects.
Given a prompt, it uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to autonomously fulfill tasks by interacting with your code base
and Github issues.

Using [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), you can create powerful,
reusable commands that can be executed by PR Pilot.

## Usage

Open a terminal and `ls` into a repository you have [installed](https://github.com/apps/pr-pilot-ai/installations/new) PR Pilot.

### Examples

You can run a prompt directly on the command line:

```bash
pilot --raw "translate the README into German" > README_German.md
```

Generate code quickly:

```bash
pilot -o test_utils.py --code "Write some unit tests for the utils.py file."
```

Get an organized view of your Github issues:

```bash
pilot "Find all open Github issues labeled as 'bug', categorize and prioritize them"
```

Generate parts of your README with a [template](./prompts/README.md.jinja2):

```bash
pilot --direct -f prompts/README.md.jinja2 -o README.md
```

For more examples, check out the [prompts](./prompts) directory in this repository.

### Options and Parameters

You can change the default settings with parameters and options:

```bash
{{ sh('python -m cli.cli --help') }}
```

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at `~/.pr-pilot.yaml`.

## Contributing
