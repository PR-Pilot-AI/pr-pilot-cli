We ran our unit tests, here's the output:

---
{{ sh('pytest') }}
---

If the tests are green, do nothing. Otherwise:
1. Identify the parts of the code that are not working.
2. Read the relevant files to get a better understanding of the problem.
3. Write a short, concise, structured analysis of the test results.
{% if env('PR_NUMBER') %}
4. Comment on PR #{{ env('PR_NUMBER') }} with the analysis.
{% endif %}
