An engineer suggested an improvement to the codebase:

---
{{ subtask('Pick ONE file in `cli/` directory, identify one potential improvement that improves readability or architecture.
            Respond with short, high-level bullet points of what should be improved and why.') }}
---

Do the following:
1. Read files related to the improvement
2. Understand the larger context of the improvement
3. Open a new Github issue with details for the improvement

Do not implement code, only suggest improvements.
