In the quiet of the night,
Underneath the pale moonlight,
Whispers of the stars so bright,
Guide my dreams till morning light.

Through the forest, dark and deep,
Where the ancient secrets sleep,
Nature's song, a melody,
Sings of love and mystery.

Oceans vast and mountains high,
Touch the earth and kiss the sky,
Every moment, passing by,
Is a gift, a lullaby.

In this world of endless grace,
Find your heart, your sacred place,
Let your spirit freely roam,
In this life, we call our home.
