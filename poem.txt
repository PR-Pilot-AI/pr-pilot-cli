In the realm of code, where logic reigns,
A symphony of thoughts, in binary chains.
Lines of purpose, functions so clear,
Crafted with care, by minds sincere.

From dawn till dusk, they weave their art,
In every loop, a beating heart.
Variables dance, in a structured ballet,
Guided by logic, they find their way.

In the world of bits, where dreams take flight,
A coder's passion, burning bright.
With every keystroke, a story unfolds,
In the language of machines, their tale is told.

So here's to the coders, both near and far,
Who turn ideas into code, like a guiding star.
In the vast expanse of the digital sea,
They shape the future, for you and me.
