In the realm of code, where logic reigns,
A symphony of thoughts, in binary chains.
Lines of purpose, functions so clear,
Crafting solutions, year after year.

From dawn till dusk, the keys they press,
In pursuit of perfection, they never rest.
With every bug fixed, a victory won,
In the endless quest, their work is never done.

Through loops and conditions, they navigate,
In the world of syntax, they innovate.
A coder's journey, both complex and grand,
Building the future, with each command.

So here's to the coders, both near and far,
Guiding us forward, like a shining star.
In the realm of code, they leave their mark,
Illuminating the world, from dawn till dark.
