### Poem 1: The License's Guard

In the realm of code, a guardian stands,
The LICENSE file, with guiding hands.
It speaks of freedom, rights to bestow,
On every coder, wherever they go.

With terms and conditions, it lays the law,
Ensuring fairness, without a flaw.
A protector of rights, both yours and mine,
In the world of software, it draws the line.

So here's to the LICENSE, our legal shield,
In the battle for freedom, it does not yield.
A testament to justice, in every clause,
For the love of code, it fights the cause.

### Poem 2: The License's Oath

Upon the code, an oath is sworn,
In the LICENSE file, it is born.
To share and modify, with freedom's grace,
A promise to keep, in every case.

It speaks of rights, and duties too,
A balance of power, for me and you.
With every clause, it sets the stage,
For a world of software, free from cage.

In the LICENSE's words, we find our way,
A path of fairness, day by day.
An oath of freedom, in code we trust,
In the LICENSE file, it is just.

### Poem 3: The License's Song

In the symphony of code, the LICENSE sings,
Of rights and freedoms, and many things.
A chorus of clauses, in harmony they stand,
Guiding the coder, with a gentle hand.

From terms to conditions, it lays out the score,
A melody of justice, forevermore.
With every right, and every clause,
The LICENSE's song, we all applause.

So let us sing, in joyous refrain,
The LICENSE's song, again and again.
For in its verses, we find our way,
In the world of code, it leads the day.
