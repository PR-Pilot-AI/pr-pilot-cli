# Poem about LICENSE

**Ode to the LICENSE**

In legal terms, so dense and grand,
The LICENSE stands, a guiding hand.
With freedoms vast and rights so clear,
It guards the code we hold so dear.

Permissions granted, none denied,
In GPL, our trust resides.
To share, to change, to freely use,
The LICENSE ensures we never lose.

So here's to the LICENSE, firm and just,
In open source, it builds our trust.
A shield, a sword, a guiding light,
The LICENSE keeps our code in sight.

**Sonnet for the LICENSE**

Within the text of GPL's embrace,
Lies freedom's promise, clear and true.
A covenant that time cannot erase,
Ensuring all can share and view.

With every clause, a right preserved,
To modify, to share, to learn.
The LICENSE stands, our code's reserve,
In every line, its principles burn.

Oh LICENSE, with your terms so fair,
You guard the work that we create.
In open source, your truths we share,
A testament to a collaborative fate.

So let us honor you, dear LICENSE file,
For keeping open source so versatile.

**Haiku for the LICENSE**

Freedoms in each line,
GPL, our code's design,
LICENSE, so divine.
