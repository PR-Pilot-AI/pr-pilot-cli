### Poem about Makefile

In the Makefile's structured land,
Commands and rules are neatly planned.
Readme updates, hooks to install,
With each command, we heed the call.

Homebrew formulas, commits so tight,
Makefile guides us day and night.
In its lines, our tasks align,
A coder's tool, truly divine.
