### Poem about README.md

In the realm of code, a guide so clear,
The README stands, with purpose near.
Commands and prompts, it does unfold,
A treasure trove, for the brave and bold.

With badges bright, it proudly shows,
The tests and versions, in neat rows.
From installation to usage grand,
It leads the way, a helping hand.

So heed the README, wise and true,
For in its words, success you'll view.
A beacon in the coding night,
Guiding you with gentle light.
