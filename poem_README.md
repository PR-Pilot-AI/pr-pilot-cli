### Poem 1: Ode to the README

In the heart of the repo, it stands so tall,
A beacon of guidance, a call to all.
With badges of honor, it proudly displays,
The essence of the project, in so many ways.

Commands and prompts, it does impart,
A manual of wisdom, a work of art.
From installation to usage, it covers the ground,
In the README, all answers are found.

So here's to the README, our guiding light,
In the world of code, it shines so bright.
A testament to clarity, a coder's best friend,
In every project, on it we depend.

### Poem 2: The README's Tale

Once upon a repo, in a land of code,
Lived a README file, with tales to be told.
It spoke of commands, and tasks to be done,
A roadmap for coders, from sun to sun.

With links to docs, and badges of pride,
It welcomed all contributors, far and wide.
From pip to brew, it showed the way,
To install the CLI, without delay.

In the README's embrace, knowledge did flow,
Helping every coder, to learn and grow.
A story of guidance, in markdown penned,
The README's tale, a coder's friend.

### Poem 3: The README's Song

In the symphony of code, the README sings,
Of installation, commands, and many things.
A chorus of badges, in harmony they stand,
Guiding the coder, with a gentle hand.

From tasks to plans, it lays out the score,
A melody of knowledge, forevermore.
With every command, and every prompt,
The README's song, we all adopt.

So let us sing, in joyous refrain,
The README's song, again and again.
For in its verses, we find our way,
In the world of code, it leads the day.
